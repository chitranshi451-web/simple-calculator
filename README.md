## 🧩 Code Overview

The program defines four simple functions:

* `add(x, y)` → returns the sum of two numbers
* `subtract(x, y)` → returns the difference
* `multiply(x, y)` → returns the product
* `divide(x, y)` → safely divides and handles division by zero

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python 3.x
  (No external libraries required — uses only standard Python functions.)
